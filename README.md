##DESCRIPTION OF DECISION TREE IMPLEMENTATION TASK : - *Tools and Libraries Used- Python: The primary programming language used for the implementation. Pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle the dataset and create the user-item matrix. NumPy: A library for numerical computations, used for handling arrays and mathematical operations. Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that provides tools for calculating cosine similarity and evaluation metrics. cosine_similarity: Used to compute the similarity between users based on their ratings. mean_squared_error: Used to calculate the mean squared error for evaluating the predictions. *Editor/Platform Used- Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment that allows for the creation and sharing of documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is particularly useful for data analysis and machine learning tasks. *Task Applicability- E-commerce: Recommendation systems can be used to suggest products to customers based on their past purchases and ratings, enhancing user experience and increasing sales. Streaming Services: Platforms like Netflix and Spotify use recommendation systems to suggest movies, shows, or music based on user preferences and viewing/listening history. Social Media: Recommendation systems can suggest friends, groups, or content based on user interactions and preferences. Online Learning: Educational platforms can recommend courses or resources based on a user's learning history and interests. Entertainment & Media - Suggesting movies (Netflix), music (Spotify), and books (Kindle). Education & E-Learning - Personalized course recommendations on platforms like Coursera and Udemy. Healthcare - Recommending health-related products or personalized treatments.
